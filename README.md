Recently, my Grandmother’s office has been repeatedly broken into. While there are cameras in the building, the thieves are wearing masks. Identification is essentially impossible. In  Addition, the cameras only tell us what’s happened after we’ve been robbed. As such, the thought of making a motion sensor crossed my mind. It should be able to detect movement 15-20 feet in front of it, sound an alarm and display a message if this is the case.
